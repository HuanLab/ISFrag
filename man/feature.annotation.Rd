\title{
Feature Annotation
}
\description{
Annotates each feature in feature table with MS2 fragment information using the dot product method.
}
\usage{
feature.annotation(featureTable, lib_directory, lib_name, dp = 0.7, ms1.tol = 0.01, ms2.tol = 0.02)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{featureTable}{
FeatureTable generated by the ms2.tofeaturetable() function containing all features with MS2 fragment information.
}
  \item{lib_directory}{
Directory containing the annotation library.
}
  \item{lib_name}{
Name of annotation library. Must be in msp format.
}
  \item{dp}{
Dot product threshold for annotating features.
}
  \item{ms1.tol}{
MS1 precursor m/z tolerance used in performing dot product calculation.
}
  \item{ms2.tol}{
MS2 m/z tolerance used in performing dot product calculation.
}
